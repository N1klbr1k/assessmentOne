// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers will determine what elements need to be included for the software to run.";
const Design = "This is the third step, in which software developers will begin to determine the syntax of their program. This step includes psuedo-code to help model how the program will run.";
const Implementation = "This step involves the actual coding of the program, and turning pseudo-code into actual typed code.";
const testingAndIntegration = "This step involves working out any bugs that arose in the process of implementation, and making sure the software works for all use cases.";
const Maintain = "The final step simply involves making sure that the code continues to run over a longer period of time, and updating it as the need arises.";
